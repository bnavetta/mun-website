                Dear Sir or Madam,
            </p>

            <p>
                On behalf of the entire BUSUN XXI Secretariat, I am delighted to inform you that <strong>we have accepted your
                delegation</strong> to our Twenty-First Annual Session of the Brown University Simulation of the United Nations!
                Thank you for your interest in our conference - we appreciate the effort you put into completing your
                application.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this time, we ask that you <strong>complete our supplementary form</strong> of logistics information
                <strong>by Friday May 19, 2017</strong>. We understand that not all of your responses may be entirely
                accurate this far in advance of the conference but we ask that you complete all questions to the best
                of your ability. Note that the <strong>most important piece of this form is delegation size</strong>,
                as the Secretariat needs a count of delegates attending during the process of creating committees.
                Please list your goal for the amount of delegates your school can reasonably commit to at this time.
                We will notify you of the number of delegates your school will be allowed shortly after all
                supplementary forms have been received.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>This form can be found if you log into to your newly-created BUSUN advisor account at busun.org.</strong>
                Your username is %recipient.advisor_email% and your temporary password is %recipient.password%. Feel free to change your password to anything your
                choice after you log in for the first time. This advisor account will be used throughout the BUSUN
                registration process as well as during the conference weekend, so please remember the password that you
                choose.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please do not hesitate to <strong>contact us with any questions or concerns</strong> about your acceptance or the
                supplementary form at <a href="mailto:info@busun.org">info@busun.org</a>. Congratulations again on your acceptance - we look forward to
                welcoming you and your students to Brown University in November!
