      not busy with BUSUN planning and logistics, Jourdan can be found adventuring in the woods, buying crazy socks to
      add to her growing collection, or exploring the Providence food scene. She is looking forward to a successful
      conference!

      volunteering with the Society of Women Engineers, and doing research in a cardiovascular engineering lab on
      campus. Colette enjoys spending her few spare moments running the hills of Providence and working on the New York
      Times Crossword puzzle. She can’t wait for BUSUN 2018!
