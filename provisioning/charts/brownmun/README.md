# Brown MUN Chart

This is a [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart for deploying the BUSUN and BUCS conference websites. Helm makes it easier to define
what other Kubernetes components (like the NGINX ingress controller) our site depends on. It also has nice support for
upgrades and rollbacks, which are useful when deploying.
