                    The Erinn Phelan Award, instituted in 2011, is granted to the delegate at BUSUN who demonstrates
                    the greatest commitment to the empowerment of women.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    This very special award is given in honor of Erinn Phelan, a former BUSUN Secretary-General.
                    Erinn was working as a coordinator in Mayor Bloombergâ€™s NYC Civic Corps when she was the victim of
                    a hit-and-run accident. She was at that time accompanied by her close friend, Alma Guerrero, who is
                    also a former BUSUN Secretary-General.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BUSUN would like to honor these women and hopes that the award will serve to motivate all delegates
                    to deepen their awareness of and commitment to women's empowerment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Erinn Phelan Award is presented to the delegate that best embodies the following qualities:
                    visionary leadership, dedication, and unwavering commitment to service. Award selection will be
                    based on the following criteria:
                </p>

                    <li>All interested delegates will be asked to submit a resume.</li>
                    <li>
                        Applicants will also be asked to submit a short response to a specific prompt that will be
                        released in advance of conference weekend.
                    </li>
