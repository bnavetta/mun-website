Dear Sir or Madam,

On behalf of the entire BUSUN XXI Secretariat, I am delighted to inform you that we have accepted your delegation to our
Twenty-First Annual Session of the Brown University Simulation of the United Nations! Thank you for your interest in our
conference - we appreciate the effort you put into completing your application.

At this time, we ask that you complete our supplementary form of logistics information
(https://busun.org/yourbusun/info) by Friday May 19, 2017. We understand that not all of your responses may be entirely
accurate this far in advance of the conference but we ask that you complete all questions to the best of your ability.
Note that the most important piece of this form is delegation size, as the Secretariat needs a count of delegates
attending during the process of creating committees. Please list your goal for the amount of delegates your school can
reasonably commit to at this time. We will notify you of the number of delegates your school will be allowed shortly
after all supplementary forms have been received.

This form can be found if you log into to your newly-created BUSUN advisor account at busun.org. Your username is
%recipient.advisor_email% and your temporary password is "%recipient.password%". Feel free to change your password to
anything your choice after you log in for the first time. This advisor account will be used throughout the BUSUN
registration process as well as during the conference weekend, so please remember the password that you choose.

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns about your acceptance or the supplementary form at
info@busun.org. Congratulations again on your acceptance - we look forward to welcoming you and your students to Brown
University in November!

Best regards,

Jourdan Smithwick
Director of External Affairs
BUSUN XXI
